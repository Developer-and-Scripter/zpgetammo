Good morning, everyone. I see that many plugins are no longer being updated and are causing a lot of errors, and people are constantly getting frustrated with various negative issues. I decided to create a plugin so that everyone can use it without any problems. The plugin is specifically designed for the Zombie Plague Mod, and anyone can benefit from it.

Plugin Name: ZP Get AmmoPacks
Plugin Version: <img src="https://raster.shields.io/badge/V3.1-green.png" alt="V3.1 logo" />
Plugin Author: HarveyWNvm
Original Plugin Author: val4o0o0

Description: ZP Get Ammo Pack V3.1 This plugin allows all players to buy 100 AmmoPacks, and after 4 hours, they can get Ammo Packs again.

Note: Each player can get Ammo Packs by typing /nfl-cs.
register_clcmd("say /nfl-cs", "cmd_ap");
register_clcmd("say_team /nfl-cs", "cmd_ap");

Please be aware that the plugin has been tested by my VIP, and it works well. However, the .sma file cannot be provided because not everyone can use that option. I respect the efforts of everyone who is working on this. If anyone wants the .sma file, they can contact me on Discord: harveywnvm#0989 to make arrangements.
